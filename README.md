# My Todos

In this project, we will practice authentication and authorization with Devise.

## Setup

To begin with, this repo is a brand new app. All I've done is add the starter_generators gem. So, to setup, just

 - Clone this repository.
 - bundle install

We'll generate our resources together.

## To catch up

At any point, to catch up,

### Using the GitHub Desktop App

From the **Repository** menu, choose **Discard Changes To Selected Files** to get rid of your changes. Now, that you are back to a clean slate, you can **Sync** to pull my latest version.

### From the Command Line

 - `git add -A`
 - `git stash`
 - `git pull`

If you get migration-related errors after that, you can

 - `rake db:drop`
 - `rake db:migrate`
